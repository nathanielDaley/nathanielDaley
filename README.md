## Hi there 👋

I'm Nathaniel Daley, a full-stack developer passionate about building engaging and efficient applications. My tech stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express.js, along with experience in Java, C, and C#.

🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of:

News Explorer – A full-featured news app I designed and coded entirely myself, from visuals to behavior.
Other Projects – A calculator, music machine, and quote generator.
Past Work – I’ve also built an FPS and a Pokémon battle simulator!
💻 I specialize in full-stack web apps but can also create PC applications. Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in video games, both playing and analyzing what makes them great. I also have 11 years of soccer experience (including 7 as a referee) and love board games & Magic: The Gathering. Oh, and I have an awesome dog named Sophie 🐶.

Let’s connect and build something great! 🚀
